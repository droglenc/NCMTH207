A couple of updates regarding the **Biometry** course you are signed up for for Winter semester. 

1. There is no commercial textbook for the course.  I have a "text" that I have written that I will make [available on-line](../book/) (and cannot be printed) or you can purchase a hard-copy through me for the cost of photocopying (I have not priced this yet but it should be <$25).  I will make arrangements on the first day of class for the purchase of the hard copy.
1. You will want to make sure that you have a good grasp on the following concepts from your Introductory Statistics course, which we will only briefly review in this course.  You can brush up on these topics by reviewing your notes from your introductory statistics course or looking at [my online Introductory Statistics book](http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/book/) and [class modules](http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/).
    * hypothesis testing concepts (null and alternative hypotheses, test statistics, p-values, rejection criterion, how to make a decision, confidence intervals), 
    * 2-sample t-tests (hypotheses, statistic, test statistics, assumptions and how to check them, confidence intervals), and 
    * linear regression (equation of the line, interpretation of the slope and intercept, making predictions, residuals, how the line is found (i.e., minimizing the RSS).
1. All analyses in this class will be done with R and the RStudio interface (I strongly urge you to update to the very latest versions of both of these softwares).  If you have a personal computer, then I urge you to install both of these programs on to it.  Instructions for installing R and RStudio are on [the resources page of the class webpage](../resources).  Please update your R/RStudio and NCStats to the very latest versions (this is critical to being able to do what you need for class).
4.	If you have never used R before, then you will need to spend extra time at the beginning of the semester working to get a grasp of this software (I will help you, of course, but this extra time will need to occur outside of the class).

Let me know if you have any questions.  I hope you all have a great and relaxing holiday break so that we can get off to a quick start next semester!
