## ANOVA Table II

A study was conducted that included 54 individuals that were evenly allocated to 6 treatment groups. The authors reported that the variance among all 54 individuals (ignoring group membership) was 47.33 and that the combined variance of individuals in each group was 33.78.

1. Use this information to construct an ANOVA table. Show your work. [*Note that you do not need R for this, beyond using* `distrib()` *to compute the p-value.*]
2. Is there a significant difference in means among the group means? [*Provide statistical evidence to support your answer*]
