## ANOVA Table I

Source     | df | SS | MS | F  | p-value
:----------|---:|---:|---:|---:|--------:
**Among**  |    |    |    |  |
**Within** | 24 | 35088 |  | - | -
**Total**  | 31 | 70907 | - | - | -

1. Complete the missing cells in the following ANOVA table. Show your work. [*Note that you do not need R for this, beyond using* `distrib()` *to computed the p-value.*]
1. How many groups were in this analysis?
1. How many individuals were in this analysis?
1. What is the estimate of the pooled variance among individuals in each group?
1. What is the estimate of the variance among individuals if groups are ignored?
1. Is there a significant difference among the groups?

## ANOVA Table III

A study was conducted that included 54 individuals that were evenly allocated to 6 treatment groups. The authors reported that the variance among all 54 individuals (ignoring group membership) was 47.33 and that the combined variance of individuals in each group was 33.78.

1. Use this information to construct an ANOVA table. Show your work. [*Note that you do not need R for this, beyond using* `distrib()` *to computed the p-value.*]
2. Is there a significant difference in means among the groups?
