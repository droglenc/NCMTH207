## Temperature and Turtle Hatchings II
<img src="../zimgs/sea_turtles.jpg" alt="Sea Turtles" class="img-right">

Continue with the turtle hatchlings data from the [previous exercise](Ex_AOVTurtles_1.html). You do not need to check the assumptions again and please do not attempt a transformation with these data. Just analyze the raw data and answer the questions below. *I suggest that you just continue with the script you used for the previous exercise.*

1. Test, at the 5% level, if the mean time to hatching differed among the four temperatures.
1. If a difference in means was identified, then (using an appropriate method) determine which group means differed significantly from each other. [*Note: Provide complete tabular AND graphical support for your answer. Your graph should clearly articulate which groups differ and which do not.*]
1. For all differences in means identified above, provide an appropriate statement that describes the amount of difference (use CIs) between the group means. [*Note: Refer to appropriate tabular results. Clearly identify which group had a larger mean.*]
1. Write an overall conclusion about the effect of temperature on the days needed to hatch by these sea turtles.
