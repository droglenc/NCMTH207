# Assumptions I
Assess the three assumptions of a One-Way ANOVA that can be tested with data using the data in [ANOVA1Assumptions1.csv](http://derekogle.com/NCMTH207/modules/ce/data/ANOVA1Assumptions1.csv). Make sure to provide specific results to support your assessments.

&nbsp;

# Assumptions II
Assess the three assumptions of a One-Way ANOVA that can be tested with data using the data in [ANOVA1Assumptions2.csv](http://derekogle.com/NCMTH207/modules/ce/data/ANOVA1Assumptions2.csv). Make sure to provide specific results to support your assessments.

## Temperature and Turtle Hatchings

In [a previous exercise](ANOVA1MultipleComparisons_CE1.html#temperature-and-turtle-hatchings) your examined the effect of sand temperature on the number of days for turgle eggs to hatch. Assess the **four** assumptions of a One-Way ANOVA for that situation. Make sure to provide specific results to support your assessments where appropriate.

# Iron and Mining
<img src="../zimgs/Iron_Mining.jpg" alt="Iron Mining" class="img-right">
Acid mine drainage is formed when water percolates into mines and oxidizes sulfide ores, generating sulfuric acid, which in turn mobilizes many different metals, including iron. In coal mining districts of the northeast, iron oxide from acid mine drainage stains many streams a brilliant orange. Reclamation projects (including sealing mine shafts and re-contouring and re-vegetating open-pit mines) have been used to reduce the severity of acid mine drainage. In one study, researchers recorded iron concentrations (mg/L) in 120 unique streams in coal-mining districts of Ohio, grouped according to land use in their basins: unmined, reclaimed (mined and later reclaimed), and abandoned (mined but never reclaimed). For a frame of reference, federal drinking water standards for color and taste permit iron concentrations up to 0.3 mg/l in drinking water. Load AcidMineDrainage.csv ([data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/AcidMineDrainage.csv), [meta](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/AcidMineDrainage_meta.txt)) into R and change the order of groups to "Unmined", "Reclaimed", and "Abandoned" as [shown here](http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/resources/FAQs/reorder-levels). Use these data to assess the **four** assumptions of a One-Way ANOVA. Make sure to provide specific results to support your assessments where appropriate.
