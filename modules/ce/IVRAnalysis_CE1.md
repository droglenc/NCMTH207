## Turtle Nesting Ecology
<img src="../zimgs/hawksbill-turtle.jpg" alt="Decoration" class="img-right">
In [this](IVRVariables_CE1.html#turtle-nesting-ecology), [this](IVRModels_CE1.html#turtle-nesting-ecology), and [this](IVRTesting_CE1.html#turtle-nesting-ecology) previous exercises you prepared variables required of an IVR, identified an ultimate full model and related sub-models, interpreted model parameters, an performed hypothesis tests. Continue with those analyses to answer the questions below.

1. Thoroughly check all assumptions on the original scale.
1. If appropriate, identify a transformation for which the assumptions are met (and show that they are met). If no transformation is needed or no transformation is better than the original scale than say so.
1. If appropriate, identify (and provide evidence for) which groups have different slopes. If not appropriate, than say so (and explain why). You may need to refer back to your parallel lines test from the previous exercise.
1. If appropriate, describe the difference in slopes for the two groups that are **most** different.
1. If appropriate, identify (and provide evidence for) whether a significant relationship exists between the (transformed?) clutch size and (transformed?) curved carapace length. If not appropriate, than say so (and explain why). You may need to refer back to your relationship test from the previous exercise.
1. If appropriate, identify (and provide evidence for) which groups have different intercepts. If not appropriate, than say so (and explain why). You may need to refer back to your coincident lines test on the previous exercise.
1. If appropriate, describe the difference in mean (back-transformed?) clutch size for the mean (back-transformed?) curved carapace length for the two groups that are **most** different.


Perform a parallel lines test. Make sure to refer to the appropriate p-value and very carefully interpret what the results mean.
1. If appropriate, perform a coincident lines test (again make sure to refer to the appropriate p-value and carefully interpret what the results mean). If it is not appropriate to perform the coincident lines test then explain why it is not.
1. If appropriate, perform the relationship test (again make sure to refer to the appropriate p-value and carefully interpret what the results mean). If it is not appropriate to perform the relationship test then explain why it is not.
