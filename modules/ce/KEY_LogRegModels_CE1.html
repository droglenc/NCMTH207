<h1>Marketability of Cucumbers</h1>
<ol>
<li>The slope indicates that at the number of days of storage increases by 1 day the the log odds that the cucumber is marketable decreases by 0.33, on average.</li>
<li>The exponentiated slope indicates that as the number of days of storage increases by 1 day the odds that the cucumber is marketable is 0.719 times lower, on average. In other words, the probability of marketability of the cucumber is only about 71.9% of what it was the day before.</li>
<li>The number of days of storage where the marketability of the cucumber is at least 0.90 is 12.8 (=<span class="math inline">\(\frac{log\left(\frac{0.9}{0.1}\right)-6.43}{-0.33}\)</span>).</li>
<li>The number of days of storage where the marketability of the cucumber is just 0.10 is 26.1 (=<span class="math inline">\(\frac{log\left(\frac{0.1}{0.9}\right)-6.43}{-0.33}\)</span>).</li>

<div id="bat-subspecies" class="section level1">
<h1>Bat Subspecies</h1>
<ol>
<li>The equation of the best-fit logistic regression line if <span class="math inline">\(log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)\)</span>=-35.516+11.112×canine.</li>
<li>The slope means that as the canine tooth height increases by 1 mm the log odds that the bat is a <em>cinereus</em> subspecies increases by between 7.589 and 15.524.</li>
<li>The exponentiated slope means that as the canine tooth height increases by 1 mm the odds that the bat is a <em>cinereus</em> subspecies increases between 1976 and 5520616 times. <em>Note that these values are so ridiculous because an increase of 1 mm essentially covers the whole range of observed canine tooth heights.</em></li>
<li>The log odds of being a <em>cinereus</em> if the canine tooth height is 3 mm is -35.516+11.112×3=<strong>-2.180</strong>.</li>
<li>The odds of being a <em>cinereus</em> if the canine tooth height is 3 mm is e<sup>-2.180</sup>=<strong>0.113</strong>. This means that the probability of being a <em>cinereus</em> is only about 11.3% as much as the probability of being a <em>semotus</em> when the canine tooth height is 3 mm. Alternatively, the probability of being a <em>semotus</em> is <strong>8.846 times more likely</strong> than being a <em>cinereus</em> when canine tooth height is 3 mm.</li>
<li>The probability of being a <em>cinereus</em> if the canine tooth height is 3 mm is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{0.113}{1+0.113}\)</span>=<strong>0.102</strong>. This means that only about 10.2% of bats with a canine tooth height of 3 mm are likely to be <em>cinereus</em>.</li>
<li>The log odds of being a <em>cinereus</em> if the canine tooth height is 4 mm is the log odds of being a <em>cinereus</em> when the canine tooth height is 3 mm <strong>PLUS</strong> the slope, or -2.180 + 11.112 = <strong>8.932</strong>.</li>
<li>The odds of being a <em>cinereus</em> if the canine tooth height is 4 is the odds of being a <em>cinereus</em> when the canine tooth height is 3 <strong>TIMES</strong> the <strong>exponentiated</strong> slope, or 0.113×66970 = <strong>7570.391</strong>.</li>
<li>The canine tooth height where it is “50-50” that the bat is <em>cinereus</em> is <strong>3.20 mm</strong> (=<span class="math inline">\(\frac{-(-35.516)}{11.112}\)</span>).</li>
<li>The canine tooth height where you are “very sure” (95% likely) that the bat is a <em>cinereus</em> is <strong>3.46</strong> mm (=<span class="math inline">\(\frac{log\left(\frac{0.95}{0.05}\right)-(-35.516)}{11.112}\)</span>).</li>
<li>The canine tooth height where you are “very sure” (95% likely) that the bat is a <em>semotus</em> (i.e., not a <em>cinereus</em>) is <strong>2.93 mm</strong> (=<span class="math inline">\(\frac{log\left(\frac{0.05}{0.95}\right)-(-35.516)}{11.112}\)</span>).</li>
