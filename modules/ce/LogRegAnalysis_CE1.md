## Moose Calf Production
<img src="../zimgs/MooseCalf.jpg" alt="Decoration" class="img-right">
[Lowe and Aderman (2014)](https://www.fwspubs.org/doi/full/10.3996/032013-JFWM-028) examined the population dynamics of Moose (*Alces alces*) in the [Togiak National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/togiak/). In one portion of this study they examined the impacts of capture and fitting with a radio-telemetry collar on the ability of female Moose to produce at least one calf. To examine this they radio-collared a number of Moose and recorded whether they produced calves or not. They did the same for a number of Moose that were not radio collared. Their results are recorded in [this Excel file](http://derekogle.com/NCMTH207/modules/ce/data/10_3996_032013-jfwm-028_s1.xls) (note that you will need to save this as a CSV). Use these data to fit a model that will allow you to determine if whether a female Moose (regardless of whether the Moose was collared or not) produced at least one calf (or not) is related to the age of the Moose.

1. Is there a significant relationship between whether or not the female had at least one calf and the age of the female? Provide evidence.
1. Interpret the meaning of the slope. Use a confidence interval.
1. Interpret the meaning of the exponentiated slope. Use a confidence interval.
1. Predict the log odds of having at least one calf if the female moose is 10-years-old.
1. Predict the odds of having at least one calf if the female moose is 10-years-old.
1. Predict the probability of having at least one calf if the female moose is 10-years-old. Use a confidence interval.
1. Predict the age at which it is 50-50 whether a moose has at least one calf or not.
