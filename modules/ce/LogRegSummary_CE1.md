# Diabetes
Health service professionals working with the [Pima peoples](http://www.native-languages.org/pima_culture.htm) were interested in developing a model that might be used to predict diabetes for women of Pima heritage from other more readily measured variables. To begin this process the researchers derived a dataset from data housed by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases for women of Pima heritage that were at least 21 years old. Their data set is in [diabetes.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCMTH207/gh-pages/modules/ce/data/diabetes.csv).[^1]

Use the plasma glucose concentration (`Glucose`) to possibly develop a model to predict the presence of diabetes or not (coded as `1`=diabetes and `0`=no diabetes in the `Outcome` variable). Please follow the workflow and the tenor of the example analyses in the reading.
