# Rattlesnake Rattling
In [this previous exercise](SLRAssumptions_CE1.html#rattlesnake-rattling) you tested the assumptions of a SLR for the relationship between the peak frequency of a rattlesnake's rattle and its weight. Use those data to answer the questions below.

1. Find an appropriate transformation for these data so that the SLR assumptions are met.
1. Is there a significant relationship between the peak frequency and weight of the rattlesnakes on the transformed scale? Provide numeric *and* graphical evidence.
1. Describe the relationship between the peak frequency and weight of the rattlesnakes on the transformed scale. Be very careful with your language and use a confidence interval.
1. Describe the relationship between the peak frequency and weight of the rattlesnakes on the *original* scale. Be very careful with your language and use a confidence interval.
1. Predict the peak frequency for **a** rattlesnake that had a weight of 454 g. Your prediction should be on the *original* scale and use an appropriate interval.
1. Predict the mean peak frequency for **all** rattlesnakes that had a weight of 454 g. Your prediction should be on the *original* scale and use an appropriate interval.
1. The authors hypothesized a power function relationship between peak frequency and weight of the rattlesnakes. Is there any evidence to support their hypothesis? What is that evidence?

# Initial COVID-19 Cases
In [this previous exercise](SLRAssumptions_CE1.html#rattlesnake-rattling) you tested the assumptions of a SLR for the relationship the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and days since the 10th case was confirmed. Use those data to answer the questions below.

1. What transformation should be used if you assume that the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases increases exponentially across the days.
1. Does this transformation allow the data to meet the SLR assumptions? Provide evidence to support your choice. [*I would make a scatterplot with the best-fit line here as well.*]
1. Is there a significant relationship between the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and days since the 10th case was confirmed? Provide numeric *and* graphical evidence.
1. Describe the relationship between the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and days since the 10th case was confirmed on the transformed scale. Be very careful with your language and use a confidence interval.
1. Describe the relationship between the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and days since the 10th case was confirmed on the *original* scale. Be very careful with your language and use a confidence interval.
1. Predict the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases for the 20th day after the 10th case was confirmed. Your prediction should be on the *original* scale and use an appropriate interval.
1. Predict the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases for the 40th day after the 10th case was confirmed. Your prediction should be on the *original* scale and use an appropriate interval. What assumptions must you make for this prediction to be meaningful? [*Note that this is not asking you to test the SLR assumptions.*]
