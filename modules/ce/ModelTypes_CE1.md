## Type of Variables?

1. Temperature (<sup>o</sup>C)
1. Habitat complexity (low, medium, high)
1. Stock price
1. Brood size (i.e., number of young)
1. Forest type (deciduous, mixed, coniferous)
1. Number of docks (on a lake shoreline)
1. Continent (North American, South America, etc.)
1. Survived (yes, no)
1. Age (years)
1. Race (White, Black, Native American, etc.)

&nbsp;

## What is the Response Variable?

1. Can length be used to predict weight?
1. How is estimated temperature affected by estimated carbon dioxide in [the EPICA Dome C ice core in Antarctica](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/global-warming/temperature-change)?
1. Does metabolic rate differ by sex of rabbit?
1. Is there a relationship between how much money a person makes and their satisfaction with deer harvest regulations?
1. Is there a relationship between how much money a person makes and how much they weigh?

<!----
1. Is gas mileage significantly affected by weight of the car?
1. How is the uptake of heavy metals affected by the sex and age (young, middle, old) of the individual?

## Type of Model

<div class="alert alert-info">
For each question below decide which type of analysis (e.g., one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, simple linear regression, indicator variable regression, or logistic regression) should be used and why. Your answer to "why" should include identifying the response variable, the explanatory variable(s), and the type and number of each variable. [<i>Hint: Use Table 1.1 from the reading.</i>]

1. A student explored the relationship between the number of calories and number of carbohydrates (in g) for each item on a Starbucks menu.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>
1. Researchers wanted to determine if the mean batting average (the proportion of hits per attempts) differed among positions (outfield, infield, and designated hitter) for major leagues baseball players.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>
1. A director of education wanted to use a students' grade-point-average in classes related to the subject matter of a certifying exam to predict whether or not a student would pass that exam on the first attempt.
1. Researchers studying anthropometry collected body girth measurements and skeletal diameter measurements, as well as age, weight, height, and sex for 507 physically active individuals. In one aspect of their research, they wanted to determine if the relationship between body weight and hip girth differed by sex (i.e., between males and females).<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>
1. Researchers wanted to determine if the body temperature of snails was affected by the color (light, intermediate, or dark) of the intertidal rock which the snail inhabited and whether the snail was found individually, in a small group (2-5 individuals), or a large group (>5 individuals).
1. An experiment was created to compare the effectiveness of various feed supplements on the growth rate of chickens. Newly hatched chicks were randomly allocated into six groups and each group was given a different feed supplement. The chicks' weights (in grams) after six weeks was recorded. Interest was in determining if mean chick weight differed among the six feed types.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>
1. The 2018 Environmental Performance Index (EPI) ranks 180 countries on 24 performance indicators covering environmental health and ecosystem vitality. These numeric metrics provide a gauge for how close countries are to established environmental policy goals and, thus, offers a scorecard that highlights leaders in environmental performance and provides guidance for countries that aspire to be leaders in sustainability. One goal with these data was to examine the relationship between an environmental health index (a numeric related to air quality, water quality, and lead exposure) and the overall EPI for 180 nations.
1. Researchers questioned whether morphological changes would occur in rodents held in captivity and whether those changes might differ by speices. To examine this question they measured the liver weight (among other things) of House Mouses (*Mus musculus*) and Deer Mouses (*Peromyscus maniculatus*) captured in the wild or raised in captivity.

<!----
1. Does bird species diversity (number of species) decline as you move away from the equator (increase latitude)?
1. Does the mean length of the anterior adductor muscle scar on a mussel species differ among five locations?
1. Does whether or not an otter captures a bluegill depend on the total length of the bluegill?
1. Does the relationship between resting heart rate and body weight differ among groups of subjects that had or had not ingested caffeine?
1. Is there a difference in fat reserves (thickness in mm) between type of seal (wild and domestic), sex of the seal (male and female), or the interaction between the seal type and sex?
1. Does the relationship between the number of times the word gender was used in a journal volume and the year of the volume (1995-2009) differ among three different journals (A, B, and C)?
1. Does mean alcohol by volume differ among different types of beer (pale ales, IPAs, lagers, stouts, and porters)?
1. Does mean alcohol by volume change depending on the weight of malt extract used in the brewing process?
