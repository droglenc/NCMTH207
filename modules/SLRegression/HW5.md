## Black Bear Weight
<img src="../zimgs/black-bear.jpg.jpg" alt="Black Bear" class="img-right">
Measuring the live body weight of large-bodied animals can be impractical when equipment needed to weigh individuals is inadequate or unavailable. Thus, the objective of Bartareau (2017) was to develop a model to accurately estimate the live body weight of Black Bears *Ursus americanus floridanus* in Florida based on the relationship between body weight as determined by a scale and sex, morphometric measurements (e.g., body length and chest girth), and age predictor variables that are more easily obtained in the field. Bartareau's data are available in BlackBear.csv  ([download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/BlackBear.csv), [meta](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/blob/master/BlackBear_meta.txt)). Use these data to determine if body weight can be predicted from body length for **non-cub** bears (i.e., older than one year of age). In doing so, answer the following questions.

1. Perform a thorough analysis of assumptions.
1. If needed, transform the data to meet the assumptions. Describe your process and show that the assumptions are adequately met on the new scale. [*Note: I strongly urge you to first consider a transformation that is most often used with data such as these that tend to follow a power function relationship.*]
1. Describe whether a significant relationship exists between the two variables.
1. If a significant relationship exists between the two variables, then carefully (and thoroughly) describe that relationship. [*Make sure to include a plot that illustrates your description.*]
1. Demonstrate how your model can be used to predict the weight for a non-cub bear given its length (you can choose the length). [*Note: Make sure to interpret the interval on the scale of interest to the researchers.*]
