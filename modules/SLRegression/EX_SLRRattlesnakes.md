## Rattlesnake Rattling
<img src="../zimgs/rattlesnake.jpg" alt="Rattlesnake" class="img-right">
[Owings *et al.* (2002)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11290950_The_Rattling_Sound_of_Rattlesnakes_Crotalus_viridis_as_a_Communicative_Resource_for_Ground_Squirrels_Spermophilus_beecheyi_and_Burrowing_Owls_Athene_cunicularia) examined how [California Ground Squirrels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_ground_squirrel) (*Spermophilus beecheyi*) and [Burrowing Owls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrowing_owl) (*Athene cunicularia*) exploited an understanding of the rattling sound of [Rattlesnakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crotalus_viridis) (*Crotalus viridis*). In one part of their study they examined the relationship betwen the weight (g) of the Rattlesnake and the peak frequency (kHz) of its rattle. They hypothesized that there would be a negative exponential relationship between how Rattlesnake weight affected the peak frequency. Data for this portion of their study are available in Rattlesnakess.csv  ([data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/Rattlesnakes.csv), [metadata](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/Rattlesnakes_meta.txt)). Use these data to examine the researcher's hypothesis. In doing so, answer the following questions.

1. Perform a thorough analysis of assumptions.
1. If needed, transform the data to meet the assumptions. Describe your process and show that the assumptions are adequately met on the new scale. [*I would start considering transformations from the perspective of the researcher's hypothesis.*]
1. Describe whether a significant relationship exists between the two variables.
1. If a significant relationship exists between the two variables, then carefully (and thoroughly) describe that relationship. [*Make sure to include a plot that illustrates your description.*]
1. Demonstrate how your model can be used to predict the mean peak frequency of the rattle for Rattlsnakes that weighed 454 g.
