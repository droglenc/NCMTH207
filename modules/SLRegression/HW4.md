## Car Horsepower and Gas Mileage
<img src="../zimgs/cars93.jpg" alt="1993 Car" class="img-right">
Students in the Introduction to Environmental Studies course were interested in what characteristics of cars affected the gas mileage (miles per gallon) of a car. Using an internet search they recorded several variables on a sample of makes of cars (note, these data are industry-reported summaries for the make of a car, not measurements on an individual car). Two of the variables that they recorded were *mpg* (miles per gallon of gasoline for the car) and *hp* (horsepower of the car engine). These data, along with many other variables are in CarMPG.csv ([download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/CarMPG.csv), [meta](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/blob/master/CarMPG_meta.txt)).  Use these data to compute a model that can be used to predict the mpg of a car based on its horsepower.

1. Assess the independence assumption.
1. Thoroughly (*use all possible options*) test the linearity assumption.
1. Thoroughly test the homoscedasticity assumption.
1. Thoroughly test the normality assumption.
1. Thoroughly test the outliers assumption.
