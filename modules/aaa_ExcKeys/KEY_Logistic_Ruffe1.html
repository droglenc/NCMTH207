<li>The fitted-line plot (Figure 1) suggests that the logistic regression model fits the proportions of larval RUffe that had consumed a <em>Daphnia</em> fairly well as indicated by the relative closeness of the modeled line to the observed proportions (i.e., blue pluses).</li>
<li>There is a significant relationship between the probability of consuming a <em>Daphnia</em> and the length of the ruffe as indicated by a p-value for the slope of the logistic regression (p&lt;0.00005; Table 1) that is less than 0.05.</li>
<li>The relationship between the probability of having consumed a <em>Daphnia</em> and the length of the ruffe cannot be described with any given number and must be described from Figure 1. From Figure 1 it is seen that this probability is “low” until about 6 mm, rises sharply to about 10 mm, and then stays high above 10 mm. Additionally, the odds of consuming a <em>Daphnia</em> are between 2.5388 and 6.1107 times greater for each increase of 1 mm in larval ruffe length (back-transformed from Table 2).</li>
<li>The odds that a 6-mm long larval ruffe had consumed a <em>Daphnia</em> is 0.0584, which means that the probability that a 6-mm long larval ruffe had consumed a <em>Daphnia</em> is only 0.0584 times the probability that it had not consumed a <em>Daphnia</em>. This indicates that the 6-mm long larval ruffe was 17.1 times more likely to NOT have consumed a <em>Daphnia</em> then it was to have consumed a <em>Daphnia</em>.</li>
<li>The probabiilty that a 6-mm long larval ruffe had consumed a <em>Daphnia</em> is 0.0552. This means that approximately one out of every 18.1 6-mm long larval ruffe will have consumed a <em>Daphnia</em>.</li>
