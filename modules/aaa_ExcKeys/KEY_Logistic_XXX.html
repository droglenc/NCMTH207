<h2>X-Rated Movies</h2>
<ol>
<li>The logistic regression model seems to fit the proportions of respondents that had seen an x-rated movie by age (i.e., blue pluses; Figure 1).</li>
<li>The estimated slope indicates that the log odds that a respondent has seen an x-rated movie decrease between 0.0425 and 0.0466, on average, for every increase in age by one year.</li>
<li>The back-transformed estimated slopes indicates that the odds that a respondent has seen an x-rated movie are between 0.9545 and 0.9584 as much after an increase of one year.</li>
<li>The log odds of having seen an x-rated movie for a 50-year-old is 0.6255+-0.0445*50 = -1.6017.</li>
<li>The log odds of having seen an x-rated movie for a 50-year-old as computed in R is also -1.6017 (see code in appendix).</li>
<li>The odds of having seen an x-rated for a 50-year-old is <span class="math inline">\(e^{-1.6017}\)</span>=0.2015.</li>
<li>The probability of having seen an x-rated for a 50-year-old is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{0.2015}{1+0.2015}\)</span>=0.1677.</li>
<li>The probability of having seen an x-rated for a 50-year-old as computed in R is also 0.1677 (see code in appendix).</li>
<li>The probability of having seen an x-rated movie for a 30-year old is 0.3294. Thus, the odds that a 30-year old has seen an x-rated movie is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{0.3294}{1-0.3294}\)</span>=0.4912.</li>
<li>The probability of having seen an x-rated movie for a 31-year old is 0.3197. Thus, the odds that a 31-year old has seen an x-rated movie is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{0.3197}{1-0.3197}\)</span>=0.4698. The ratio of the odds for the 31-year-old to the odds of the 30-year-old is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{0.4698}{0.4912}\)</span> = 0.9564, which is the same as the back-transformed slope (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(e^{-0.0445}\)</span>).</li>
