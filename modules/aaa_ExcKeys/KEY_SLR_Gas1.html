<strong>Note:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
In the first question, “coefficients” simply refer to the parameter estimates under the “Est” column heading. No other value in the table from <code>summary()</code> is considered a coefficient.

<h2>Car Horsepower and Gas Mileage I</h2>
<ol>
<li>The results of <code>summary()</code> are in Table 1. Interpretations of the coefficients are below.
<ul>
<li>The y-intercept (46.93) is the estimated mean mpg for cars with no horsepower.</li>
<li>The slope (i.e., the “hp” “Estimate”) says that for every increase in one horsepower the mpg will <em>decrease</em> by 0.22, on average.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interpretations of the p-values in Table 1 are below.
<ul>
<li>The “Intercept” p-value (p&lt;0.00005) shows that the mean mpg for cars with no horsepower is different than zero (a nonsensical significance test).</li>
<li>The slope (in “hp” row) p-value (p&lt;0.00005) shows that the slope is significantly different from zero, which indicates that there is a significant relationship between the horsepower and mpg of a car.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The coefficient of determination (“multiple r-squared”; 0.78) is the proportion of the total variability in mpg (ignoring horsepower) that is explained away by knowing a horsepower value.</li>
<li>Confidence intervals for the model coefficients are in Table 2. Interpretations for each confidence interval are below.
<ul>
<li>The “intercept” CI says that the mean mpg for cars with no horsepower is between 43.0 and 50.8.</li>
<li>The slope (i.e., “hp” row) CI says that the mpg will <em>decrease</em> between 0.18 and 0.25 for a one unit increase in horespower.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The ANOVA table is shown in Table 3. How each degrees-of-freedom is calculated is below.
<ul>
<li>The regression df (in the “hp” row) df is one less than the number of parameters estimated (2 – intercept and slope).</li>
<li>The residual df is the number of observations (42) minus the number of parameters estimated (2).</li>
<li>The total df is not shown on the table but is equal to the number of observations minus 1.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The meanings of each MS in Table 3 are below.
<ul>
<li>The MS regression (in the “hp” row) is the variance in mpg that can be explained by knowing the value of horespower.</li>
<li>The MS residual is the variance in mpg after considering horsepower or the variability of individuals around the best-fit line (i.e., the full model).</li>
<li>The total MS is not shown in the table but is the variance in mpg or the variability of individuals around the grand mean (i.e., the simple model).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The F test statistic is the ratio of variability in mpg explained by knowing the value of horespower to the variability unexplained even after knowing the value of the horsespower. The F (141.5) and corresponding p-value (p&lt;0.00005) show that the full model including the slope is significantly “better” than the simple model with no slope. Thus, a slope “is needed” and it can be concluded that there is a significant relationship between a car’s horespower and its gas mileage.</li>
<li>There is a significant relationship as indicated by the very small slope and F-test p-values (p&lt;0.00005).</li>
<li>The relationship between a car’s mpg and horsepower is shown in Figure 1.</li>
