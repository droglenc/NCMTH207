Use the preparation readings and videos to prepare written answers for the following questions. Please contact <a href="mailto:dogle@northland.edu">Dr. Ogle</a> if you have questions.
</div>

1. What is the general F-ratio test statistic? Write down three versions of it (the general version, not the version specific to the different tests).
1. What is a parallel lines test?
1. How do the hypotheses differ in a parallel lines test?
1. What do the hypotheses look like, graphically, in a parallel lines test?
1. What is a coincident lines test?
1. How do the hypotheses differ in a coincident lines test?
1. What do the hypotheses look like, graphically, in a coincident lines test?
1. What is a relationship test?
1. How do the hypotheses differ in a relationship test?
1. What do the hypotheses look like, graphically, in a relationship test?
1. Which of the parallel lines, coincident lines, or relationship test must be conducted first? Explain why.
1. When should a coincident lines test be conducted? Why?
1. What conclusion can be made if the lines are not coincident but they are parallel? Explain why.
1. How do you efficiently get p-values for all three tests in R?
1. What specifically can you conclude if the parallel lines test rejects H<sub>0</sub> and there are more than two groups?
1. What specifically can you conclude if the parallel lines test does not reject H<sub>0</sub>, the coincident lines test rejects H<sub>0</sub>, and there are more than two groups?
1. What specifically can you conclude if the parallel lines and coincident lines tests both reject H<sub>0</sub>, the relationship test does not reject H<sub>0</sub>, and there are more than two groups?
