1. What are the five assumptions of a SLR?
1. What are the five most common transformations (by name and by power value)?
1. Which of those five transformations is the transformation that you should try first and that you hope works (relative to the other transformations)? Why?
1. What transformation "linearizes" a power function relationship?
1. How can you use the results on the transformed scale to estimate the $a$ and $b$ parameters of a power function?
1. What transformation "linearizes" an exponential function relationship?
1. How can you use the results on the transformed scale to estimate the $a$ and $b$ parameters of an exponential function?
1. What R function is used to perform the trial-and-error method of finding a power transformation in SLR?
1. For which transformations is it possible to get an interpretable value after back-transforming a y-intercept, fitted value, or predicted value?
1. For which transformations is it possible to get an interpretable value after back-transforming a slope?
1. What is the interpretation of the slope when only the response variable was transformed?
1. What is the interpretation of a back-transformed slope when only the response variable was transformed?
1. What is the interpretation of the slope when both the response and explanatory variables were transformed?
1. What is the interpretation of a back-transformed slope when both the response and explanatory variables were transformed?
