Use the preparation readings and videos to prepare written answers for the following questions. Please contact <a href="mailto:dogle@northland.edu">Dr. Ogle</a> if you have questions.

1. Thoroughly compare and contrast a (generic) simple and full models. You should have at least five characteristics that you discuss.
1. Define Y<sub>ij</sub>, Y&#772;<sub>i$\cdot$</sub>, Y&#772;<sub>$\cdot\cdot$</sub>, n<sub>i</sub>, n, &epsilon;<sub>ij</sub>.
1. What is the simple model in a 2-sample t-test. Express this in symbols, in words, and graphically.
1. What is the full model in a 2-sample t-test. Express this both in symbols, in words, and graphically.
1. What is SS<sub>Total</sub>? Express this as a formula and in words with respect to residuals from a model (be specific about which model), as a measure of lack-of-fit, and graphically.
1. What is SS<sub>within</sub>? Express this as a formula and in words with respect to residuals from a model (be specific about which model), as a measure of lack-of-fit, and graphically.
1. Show how SS<sub>Total</sub> partitions into two components.
1. What is SS<sub>Among</sub>? Express this as a formula and in words with respect to comparing two models (be specific about models), as it relates to lack-of-fit, and graphically.
1. Explain how SS<sub>Among</sub> changes as the difference in group means is increased.
1. Explain how SS<sub>Among</sub> changes relative to SS<sub>Within</sub> as the difference in group means is increased.
1. Is SS<sub>Among</sub> a measure of "signal" or "noise"? A measure of "benefit" or "cost" (of using the full model)?
1. What does df<sub>Among</sub> measure? Express this in relation to two models.
1. How do you convert any SS to a "true variance"?
1. MS<sub>Total</sub> and MS<sub>Within</sub> measure the variability of what "entities"?
1. How do MS<sub>Total</sub> and MS<sub>Within</sub> differ?
1. MS<sub>Among</sub> measures the variability of what "entities"?
1. How is an F test statistic computed?
1. What does a "large" F test statistic mean? Answer this in terms of "signal" and "noise", variability explained and unexplained (be specific about what is "explaining"), simple and full models, and null and alternative hypotheses.
1. What does a "small" p-value (computed from an F test statistic) mean? Answer this in terms of "signal" and "noise", variability explained and unexplained (be specific about what is "explaining"), simple and full models, and null and alternative hypotheses.
