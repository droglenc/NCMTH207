1. Define *factor*, *levels*, *treatments*, and *replicates*. [Note that you may need to refer to [your "Data Production" chapter from your introductory statistics course.](http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/DataProduction.html)]
1. Define each of the following symbols -- *a*, *b*, *m*, *i*, *j*, and *k*.
1. What generic symbols are used for each of the following:
    1. Observed response variable for an individual.
    1. Grand mean
    1. Level means for Factor A.
    1. Level means for Factor B.
    1. Treatment means.
1. What are formulae for the following:
    1. SS<sub>Total</sub> and df<sub>Total</sub>.
    1. SS<sub>Within</sub> and df<sub>Within</sub>.
    1. SS<sub>Among</sub> and df<sub>Among</sub>. [*Note: you should have two formulae for each.*]
    1. SS<sub>A</sub> and df<sub>A</sub>.
    1. SS<sub>B</sub> and df<sub>B</sub>.
    1. SS<sub>A:B</sub> and df<sub>A:B</sub>.
    1. Total number of individuals.
    1. Total number of treatments.
1. Which "symbol" would be attached to each of the following:
    1. Sum of squared residuals of individuals around the treatment/group means.
    1. Sum of squared residuals of individuals around the grand mean.
    1. Sum of squared differences between treatment means and the grand mean.
    1. Sum of squared differences between Factor A level means and the grand mean.
    1. Sum of squared differences between Factor B level means and the grand mean.
1. Define each of the following in terms of what variance it measures: MS<sub>Total</sub>, MS<sub>Within</sub>, MS<sub>Among</sub>, MS<sub>A</sub>, and MS<sub>B</sub>.
1. The ANOVA table has three F-ratio test statistics. Show how each one is calculated.
