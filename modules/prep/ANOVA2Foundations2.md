Use the preparation readings and videos to prepare written answers for the following questions. Please contact <a href="mailto:dogle@northland.edu">Dr. Ogle</a> if you have questions.

1. Define *factor*, *levels*, *treatments*, and *replicates*. [Note that you may need to refer to [your "Data Production"" chapter from your introductory statistics course.](http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/DataProduction.html)
1. Define each of the following symbols -- *a*, *b*, *m*, *i*, *j*, and *k*.
1. What generic symbols are used for each of the following:
    1. Observed response variable for an individual.
    1. Grand mean
    1. Level means for Factor A.
    1. Level means for Factor B.
    1. Treatment means.
1. What are formulae for the following:
    1. SS<sub>Total</sub> and df<sub>Total</sub>.
    1. SS<sub>Within</sub> and df<sub>Within</sub>.
    1. SS<sub>Among</sub> and df<sub>Among</sub>. [*Note: you should have two formulae for each.*]
    1. SS<sub>A</sub> and df<sub>A</sub>.
    1. SS<sub>B</sub> and df<sub>B</sub>.
    1. SS<sub>A:B</sub and df<sub>A:B</sub>
    1. Total number of individuals.
    1. Total number of treatments.
1. Which symbol would be attached to each of the following:
    1. "Total sum" of square residuals of individuals around the treatment/group means.
    1. "Total sum" of square residuals of individuals around the grand mean.
    1. "Total sum" of square differences between treatment means and the grand mean.
    1. "Total sum" of square differences between Factor A level means and the grand mean.
    1. "Total sum" of square differences between Factor B level means and the grand mean.
1. Define each of the following in terms of what variance it measures: MS<sub>Total</sub>, MS<sub>Within</sub>, MS<sub>Among</sub>, MS<sub>A</sub>, and MS<sub>B</sub>.
1. The ANOVA table has three F-ratio test statistics. Show how each one is calculated.
