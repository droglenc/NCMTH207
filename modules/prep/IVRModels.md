Use the preparation readings and videos to prepare written answers for the following questions. Please contact <a href="mailto:dogle@northland.edu">Dr. Ogle</a> if you have questions.

1. In what order should the variables be entered into the ultimate full model for an IVR?
1. On what variables should the &alpha;, &beta;, &delta;<sub>i</sub>, and &gamma;<sub>i</sub> coefficients be attached?
1. How many sub-models are there if the ultimate full model has three indicator (and three interaction) variables? Explain.
1. How many &delta;<sub>i</sub> are there in an ultimate full model representing three groups? Explain.
1. How many &gamma;<sub>i</sub> are there in an ultimate full model representing three groups? Explain.
1. What does the generic sub-model always look like for the reference group?
1. What would the generic sub-model look like for the third (of four) groups?
1. Explain what &alpha;, &beta;, &delta;<sub>i</sub>, and &gamma;<sub>i</sub> measure or represent.
1. What are the signs (positive, negative, zero) for &alpha;, &beta;, &delta;<sub>1</sub>, and &gamma;<sub>2</sub> if two lines are parallel with a negative slope and the line for the "reference group" is above the line for the other group.
1. In what order should the explanatory variables be entered into the formula in `lm()` to fit the ultimate full model for an IVR?
1. What parameter estimate is found in the row of output labeled with "(Intercept)"? The row labeled with the indicator variable?
