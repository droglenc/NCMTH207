## ANOVA Table
<img src="../zimgs/lecture.jpg" alt="Lecture" class="img-right">
An experiment was conducted at a large university to determine whether two different instructional methods for teaching a beginning statistics course would yield different levels of achievement. One instructional method involved using a self-instructional format, including a sequence of slide-tape presentations. The other method utilized the standard lecture format. The 100 students who registered for the course were randomly assigned to one of four sections, 25 per section, corresponding to the combinations of one of the two methods with one of two instructors (A and B). The summarized results from identical final exams in the four sections are below.

        Score      LectA        25      75.45      75.15      14.76
                   LectB        25      74.46      74.48      13.25
                   SelfA        25      83.98      79.97      13.59

Use these result to complete the ANOVA table below. This question can be hand-written, but clearly show your work for all calculations.  No functions, beyond using `distrib()` to calculate p-values, will be useful for these calculations.
