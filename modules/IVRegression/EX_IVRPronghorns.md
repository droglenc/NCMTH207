## Growth of Pronghorn Antelopes
<img src="../zimgs/pronghorn_antelope.jpg" alt="Pronghorn Antelope" class="img-right">
In an effort to determine effective hand-raising protocols for Pronghorn Antelope (*Antilocapra americana*), [Martin and Parker (1997)](https://jmammal.oxfordjournals.org/content/jmammal/78/1/23.full.pdf){:target="_blank"} examined the growth rates (i.e., change in body weight over time) of two groups of pronghorn for the first 16 weeks of their lives. The first group consisted of "tame" animals. The second group originated from wild stock and was labeled "diet-curtailed" because their diet of artificial milk had to be curtailed to avoid problems with diarrhea. Martin and Parker measured the body weight (kg) of each animal on the same day of the week for each week in a 16-week period.

1. Construct an indicator variable such that the "diet-curtailed" group is the reference group. [*Note: Provide a clear name for the variable and clearly define what 0 and 1 mean.*]
1. Write the ultimate full model for an indicator variable regression with these data.
1. Show all possible submodels that can be constructed from your ultimate full model.
1. Carefully interpret the meaning of each parameter in your ultimate full model.
1. Write the models in the null and alternative hypothesis for a parallel lines test.
1. Write the models in the null and alternative hypothesis for an intercepts test (assuming that the lines are parallel).
