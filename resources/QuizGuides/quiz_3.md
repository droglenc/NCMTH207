The third quiz (see [dates page](../Dates-Current)) will cover the following material:

1. Identify likely interaction and main effects from paired interaction plots. This will be like [Interaction Plots Exercise](../../modules/Anova-2Way/Ex_AOV2Plots). 
1. Complete an incomplete ANOVA table and answer a few questions from it. This will **NOT** require you to compute SS from means as was done in [ANOVA Table - Cattails Exercise](../../modules/Anova-2Way/Ex_AOV2Cattails). You will need to know the relationships between df, SS, MS, and F values for row, column, interaction, within, and total sources (the table will **NOT** have an overall among row).
1. Answer the following questions
    * Thoroughly explain why one experiment where two factors are simultaneously manipulated is “better” than two separate experiments where one factor at a time is manipulated. Demonstrate your points with an illustrative example, assume that there is a total of 48 individuals available for experimentation and that one factor has three levels and the other factor has four levels. [*Note that it will be important to explain statistical words like "power" and "interaction effects" rather than just saying them.*]
    * Explain why main factor effects cannot be interpreted if there is an interaction effect. Provide a concrete example.
1. Answer questions from R for a two-way ANOVA analysis. This will be most similar to [Analysis-Sessile Organisms Exercise](../../modules/Anova-2Way/Ex_AOV2Sessile). [Here is an example from a previous year’s exam](Q3_Example.pdf). *Note that this is an example only; the actual question will be different than this one.*

The quiz is closed book and closed notes, you will not need to use R (but will need to be able to interpret results provided from R), you should bring a calculator and a pencil (exams written in pen will not be accepted), and be prepared to write neatly.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks.
