The fifth quiz (see [dates page](../Dates-Current)) will cover the following material:

1. Show how to linearize an exponential or power-law model and then identify which variables should be transformed and how the original parameters of these models relate to the intercept and slope on the transformed scale.
1. Answer questions about variables, models, submodels, model parameters, and models in specific hypothesis tests for an IVR. This will be very much like [IVR Homework #1](../../modules/IVRegression/HW1).
1. Answer questions from R for an analysis of an IVR. Four analyses will be provided that are all combinations of untransformed and transformed data and the response and explanatory variables reversed. Thus, you will need to determine what the correct response variable is (this will eliminate two of the analyses) and then whether the data should have been transformed or not (this will eliminate a third analysis). This will be similar to [IVR Homework #2](../../modules/IVRegression/HW2). In addition, make sure that you can write the equations for each submodel with values from the results replacing each parameter; interpret the results of the parallel lines, coincident lines, and relationship tests; and describe all output from `compSlopes()` and `compIntercepts()`. [Here is an example from a previous yearâ€™s exam](Q5_Example.pdf). *Note that this is an example only; the actual question will be different than this one.*

The quiz is closed book and closed notes, you will not need to use R (but will need to be able to interpret results provided from R), you should bring a calculator and a pencil (exams written in pen will not be accepted), and be prepared to write neatly.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks.
