<div class="alert alert-warning">
Below are two examples demonstrating the format that I would prefer for your Biometry portfolio proposal. Please note that you will have four (not two) sections in your actual proposal.
</div>


* Analysis #1 (Simple Linear Regression)
    * **Data**: The weight (grams) and fork length (mm) of Slimy Sculpin (*Cottus cognatus*) from Toolik Lake, Alaska. I gathered these data from the Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) website (http://arc-lter.ecosystems.mbl.edu/arclterlakesfish1986-2009). I will restrict my analysis to just fish captured in 1987.
    * **Question/Hypothesis**: I wish to determine if the weight of a Slimy Sculpin can be adequately predicted from the fork length. This will be useful as it is much easier to measure the length of a fish than it is to weigh it, especially in the Arctic.
    * **Response Variable**: The response variable for this analyis is the weight of the Slimy Sculpin. This variable is quantitative continuous.
    * **Explanatory Variale**: The explanatory variable for this analysis i the fork length of the Slimy Sculpin. This variable is quantitative continuous.
    * **Topic**: I will use a simple linear regression for this analysis as both the response and explanatory variables are quantitative.
