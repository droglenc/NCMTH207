# Coral Reef Disturbance
[Schmitt *et al.* (2019)](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/10/4372) used an experiment with a coral reef to examine the ecological theory that under the same environmental conditions, an ecosystem could have more than one community state that is maintained by reinforcing feedbacks. In one part of that study the researchers wanted to test how resilient patches of a coral reef that are dominated by the [*Turbinaria* coral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbinaria_(coral)) are to varying levels of disturbances. Thus, the authors selected patches on a large coral reef that were spatially distant. For each patch they recorded the number of *Turbinaria* individuals. They then randomly selected which patches would receive one of three simulated disturbance treatments. Some patches were left undisturbed as a control, whereas other patches had large bouyant adult individuals removed to simulate a single "large wave" disturbance, and other patches had both adult and some juveniel individuals removed to simulate a more sustained cyclonic storm. The researchers returned to each patch 26 months later and again recorded the number of *Turbinaria* individuals. The researchers ultimately want to determine if there is a relationship between the post-disturbance and pre-disturbance numbers of *Turbinaria* and if that relationship is affected by the type of disturbance. The data for this study are in [**CoralReefs.csv**](data/CoralReefs.csv).

# Butterfly Abundance
Researchers at the University of Colorado-Boulder investigated the effects of habitat characteristics and urbanization on grassland butterfly diversity in 1999 and 2000. The researchers identified 66 sites in the [Boulder County Open Space areas](https://www.bouldercounty.org/departments/parks-and-open-space/) that were as spatially separated as possible while also covering a variety of habitats and urbanization. The researchers recorded four broad habitats for each site (short grass, mixed (short and tall) grass, tall grass, and hayfield) and measurements of the density of buildings and the amount of urban vegatation (i.e., planted trees, shrubbery, and grasses). The researchers also went to each site July and August 1999 and June, July, and August 2000 to recorded the number of individuals of 30 species of butterflies. For this analysis, they wanted to determine if the mean number of *all* species of butterflies combined differed among the four broad habitat types. The data for this study are in [**Butterflies.csv**](data/Butterflies.csv).

# Snowmelt
[Billy Barr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Barr_(naturalist)) is an amateur natural historian living at the base of Gothic Mountain, CO. In the early 1970s he bagan keeping [phenological records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenology) to [stave off boredom](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/01/billy-barr-climate-change/512198/). One of the things that he recorded was the last day that any snow existed on a 5x5 m plot near his home. These data have been used by numerous scientists to understand how climate change is affecting local phenology. [Campbell (2019)](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/26/12901) used and extended Barr's data to better understand the effect of shorter winters on the populations of subalpine plants. In one part of her study she examined the relationship between the Barr's last day of snow (i.e., the day of snowmelt recorded as the number of days since January 1) and the year of the recording. She used this relationship to predict when the several species of plants would be in critical danger of going extinct. Use the data in [**snowmelt.csv**](data/snowmelt.csv) to determine if the snowmelt date has decreased over time.

# Soil Phosphorous
Soil phosphorous is important for the invasion of native vegetation by exotic weeds. [Clements (1983)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.1983.tb01328.x) studied the soil phosphorous near Sydney (Australia) to determine how soil phosphorous varied with topographical location and soil type. Bushland sites were chosen in [Brisbane Waters National Park](https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/visit-a-park/parks/brisbane-water-national-park), [Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park](https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/visit-a-park/parks/kuringgai-chase-national-park), and [Royal National Park](https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/visit-a-park/parks/royal-national-park) as these areas were relatively unaffected by suburban development, were free from immediate roadside or track effects, and had not been burned for at least two years. Shale-derived and sandstone-derived soils in four topographic locations were examined with three 250 m^2^ quadrats in each of the eight combinations of soil type and topography. Cores of soil of 75 mm depth and 25 mm diameter, free from surface litter, were collected from each of five randomly selected points in each quadrat. The five soil samples were pooled and the total soil phosphorous (ppm) was determined for each pooled sample. Use the data in [**SoilPhosphorous.csv**](data/SoilPhosphorous.csv) to determine the effects of soil type (shale- or sandstone-derived) and topographic location on phosphorous levels.

# Yellow Perch Barotrauma
Many fishes cannot regulate the air in their air bladder when they are pulled quickly from deep waters (this phenomenon is called [barotrauma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barotrauma)). Because of this, many fishes may die when releases after being captured. [Knight *et al.* (2019)](https://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article/10/1/69/204139/Is-Barotrauma-an-Important-Factor-in-the-Discard#11051974) examined the effect of barotrauma on the discard mortality of Yellow Perch (*Perca flavescens*) in Lake Erie. One particular area of interest in their research was the effect of depth of capture on the incidence of mortality for Yellow Perch. To examine this, they captured Yellow Perch in gillnets set at a variety of depths during a variety of months over six years. For each fish captured, the researchers recorded the fish's total length, whether the fish exhibited signs of barotrauma or not, and at what depth it was captured. These data are found in [**barotrauma.csv**](data/barotrauma.csv). Use these results to examine the effect of dept of capture on signs of barotrauma.
